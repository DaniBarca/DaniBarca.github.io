Sometimes more, sometimes less, I've been blogging since I was a kid. I've allways liked having a place where I could share the things I was interested in, and where I could express myself.

Nevertheless, as many others have experienced themselves, it can require some will power to keep posting with a reasonable frequency. Being young, a blog was almost the only space where I could express myself, but nowadays other social networks like Twitter are more than enough for almost anything I'd want to say.

Anyway I like the idea of having my own space, with my own domain name, where people can see who I am. I'm not sure whether I'll be consistent with the blog but I'll try to post something from time to time.

Also, as a personal challenge I decided to start writing in English. Yeah, that is like twice the effort it takes me to write something in Spanish or Catalan, but also a nice excuse to keep learning, and why not, show myself and others that I can handle it. I feel comfortable enough with English to be able to write quite complex posts, but I know that I will make some mistakes so I'm apologizing in advance. Feel free to scold me when I do, I'm trying to learn anyway :)

This time I decided to adopt [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages") as the technology for the blog. This is not only really cheap (it's free) but also reflects better than Wordpress the way I use technology. Jekyll generates an static website given some text and configuration files, and GitHub pages works as a nice and free hosting for static sites.

It's kind of funny how static web pages have ended to be "next big thing" after so many years of complicating web technologies more and more. Less is more. Why would I want to fully generate my site every time someone accesses it? It's amazing the huge amount of resources we are all spending right now into dynamically generating sites that are not really going to change in months, or even years. Static sites are blazing fast and more than enough for a simple blog like this. Not to mention that Wordpress and PHP have become **huge** dinosaurs (I'm sorry to say this, I see the work behind this tools, but it's the truth).

That said, Jekyll can be right now a bit confusing to use for most people (I needed some time before having this site working), so I think that in the coming years this technology is going to evolve to some kind of CMS-ey generators that can allow to add content without struggling with codes, file formats, command lines, et cetera.

That's why along with Jekyll I decided to try [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) as a CMS for writing posts. It's still pretty new and it's easy to find stuff to polish here and there, but they are doing a nice work on it: it's fully functional and one can see how there's an interesting future in this kind of tools. For every change I do to the website, Forestry automatically pushes a new commit to the GitHub repository, and since GitHub Pages builds Jekyll repositories also automagically, this is enough for having it published if it's correctly configured (which is not so trivial anyway, at least the first time you do it).

I'm also using [Godaddy](http://godaddy.com) for the domain register and [Cloudflare](http://cloudflare.com) for its CDN and idiot-proof SSL.
