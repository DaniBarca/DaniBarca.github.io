title: Self-disappointment

---
This has been a year of challenges for me. I put myself in a situation where I faced a great exigence, that has forced me to put aside many things in my life. As is usual in me, it has also been a year of self-evaluation, and I think I have learned a lot.

Nothing in this post is of my own invention. I do not pretend to myself as an authority in the matter but to share a series of thoughts and conclusions I've drawn.

## What is disappointment

It is much easier to understand self-disappointment if we start by thinking about disappointing another person, and what does that imply. The simplest form of disappointment I can think of is to not show up for an appointment.

So let's imagine you are looking for a partner and you resort to a dating application. You meet someone there who is nice and end up setting up a date at a certain place and hour. For whatever reason you do not show up and don't get to tell the other person until the last minute.

It's understandable how that is a disappointment for the other. He or she probably has better things to do and might be emotionally invested into it, so considering you don't know each other yet it is very unlikely that you are going to be trusted again for a second date. Even if the other person decides that your excuse is good enough to try again, it's not going to be the same: trust has already been broken.

When faced with this example the first thing we think about is: well, I can't just fulfill everything I promise, even if I want to. At some point something is going to happen that will prevent us from satisfying a promise. But unless that something is that a bus ran over you, your explanation will not matter.

What happens if what you promised is to finish a report for your boss on monday, or that you would clean the dishes before leaving home this morning?

 The first thing I have understood this year is that promising something and not delivering does a huge damage to my image. That other person you promised something to might love you or be very understanding with your situation, maybe nothing happens so you just keep going but the disappointments accumulate and, at some point, someone will decide that you are not trustworthy if you don't do anything about it.

There are three things we can do about our promises without disappointing anyone:

1. Not promising:

   This one is pretty hard for me. Turns out that, for the way I am, I tend to seek other people's approval by committing to solve a problem. I would like to be a very effective person and thus I try to fulfill that vision of myself.

   Probably the task, or part of it, can be done by other. If you do not commit to doing it there will not be disappointment at all; and if you are reasonable about it you will be seen as someone who understand its limitations and can be trusted.
2. Renegotiating:

   Many things can happen that prevent us from fulfilling something. Sometimes it is perfectly fine to reschedule or find another one to do something. If you find the proper timing for it, there won't be any damage to your image.
3. Doing it:

   If the 2 first options are not available, whatever the reason, the only option left is to just do it. Think about your options, search other tasks that you can reschedule instead of this one.

## Self disappointment

All this applies for when the person you are disappointing is yourself, but the consequences are more complex. How many times have you told yourself that you would change, that this was the the day you would change
